## About

### Advantages over other admission websites: 

+ While most college websites only allow you to compare colleges 1 at a time, users use the dashboard to compare 2 colleges side by side. 
+ Users can look at a wide range of variables including: school stats, tuition, completion rate, debt, diversity, standardized scores, earnings after enrollment, and many more. 
+ This Dashboard allows users to adjust variables and observe changes over time. 



## Sources

+ You can find all of the data on the US Department of Education's [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/).
+ I used two main references to produce the charts in the dashboard Tom Bishop's [Highcharter Cookbook](https://www.tmbish.me/lab/highcharter-cookbook/) and Joshua Kunst Fuentes' [blog](http://jkunst.com/blog/posts/2019-02-04-using-tooltips-in-unexpected-ways/)
